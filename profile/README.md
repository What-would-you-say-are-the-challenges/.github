# What would you say are the challenges in curating a good collection of mods? 

I would certainly recommend against just throwing all of the mods into the Luau pot without any research. This will create more work for you in the long run (and the governor will NOT love the flavor!)

There can be conflicts between mods or their requirements so a lot of reading is necessary. I found it helpful when I picked a mod to consider what other mods were supported by its requirements, to help keep my requirements list under control. 

There also needs to be an understanding of the kind of game experience you want to create, and considering the collection categories might be a good place to start. Do you want to create a Total Overhaul or a Vanilla Plus collection? Maybe a Themed Collection, or an Essentials Collection? Or is your idea something totally different?

Before you start your list I'd recommend looking at what is already available. Review collections and popular mods to get an idea of what your collection might contain. You might even find another curator has already done the work for you!
